ISA: Traffic-ASP (minimal)

Registers: R0-R15 (R0 is always zero)

Memory: byte-addressed memory for LW/SW (word size = 4 bytes)

Instruction formats (assembly-like text):

- ADD rd, rs, rt    ; rd = rs + rt
- SUB rd, rs, rt    ; rd = rs - rt
- LW rd, imm(rs)    ; rd = MEM[rs + imm]
- SW rs, imm(rd)    ; MEM[rd + imm] = rs
- BEQ rs, rt, label ; if (rs == rt) PC = label
- J label           ; PC = label
- OUT port, rs      ; write register value to an output port (simulated)
- NOP               ; no-op

Additional pseudo-op:
- SET rd, imm       ; rd = imm (load immediate)

Notes:
- Immediate `imm` is a signed integer.
- Labels are defined as `label:` at the start of a line.
